<p>My name is Jun Taek, and I'm an undergraduate student at Grinnell College
studying majoring in Mathematics and Psychology. Until recently, I was 
uncertain about what I wanted to do in life and where I saw myself in the 
future. Having done research in pure mathematics (ask me about hypergroups)
and non-linear dynamics (and about multifractals), I saw a natural path in
academia doing research. Specifically, I wanted to apply non-linear dynamics
in cognitive science.

<p>It was only recently that I found the amazing field of data science. Upon
a friend's suggestion, I took the Machine Learning course on Coursera taught
by Professor Andrew Ng at Stanford University, and I was astonished by the
wonderfully complex and fascinating methods data scientists use to answer 
complicated questions. My favorite problem so far is a simple one--can you
create a model to distinguish dogs and cats from an image (thanks Kaggle)? 
I feel very strongly about pets, if you couldn't tell (dog person here). 

<p>I am still learning and exploring about where I want to apply data science
in the future, but so far I am thinking about applications in cognitive
sciences or at mission driven NPOs or businesses, like LinkedIn or Unilever.
I am also passionate about education, so I would be interested in pursuing 
data science education at some point down the line.

<p>Please check out my CV for my qualifications and contact information.
