# Logistic Regression  

Our group was a little smaller this week, but with all the events happening
and the Alumni Council visiting campus this weekend, I'm going to assume we're
still going strong! I guess any size of group works for me since every size of
groups has its benefits. Anyways, this week we talked about logistic regression,
the foundation of classification problems.  

Next week is the weekend before mid-semester week, so I'm guessing a lot of
people will not show up. I have no exams or papers (this entire semester) so I
will still be there working on some projects. Feel free to stop by to chat or
start thinking about projects you can start working on. I won't be teaching much
from now on, since I think understanding linear and logistic regression
thoroughly gets you through the basics of machine learning.  

Lastly, Grinnell Pioneer Weekend 2017 just got announced for April 7-9. This is
a business-hackathon-ish event where you come up with ideas for a startup. The
judges choose what they think are the best ideas and award $2000, $1000, and
$500 to the winning three teams. You should definitely check it out!

That's all I have for you. See you all next weekend or after spring break!  

# Summary 2017-03-03  

This week, we talked about extending the concepts and framework we learned from
linear regression into the realm of classification. Logistic regression is the
most standard/simple method of creating a model to classify data based on
qualitative categories. I would argue that most classification methods are simply
extensions of logistic regression. After learning about logistic regression, you
will have the tools to analyze most of the simple data you would come across.  

## What is logistic regression?  

Logistic regression is in a family of regression models called the Generalized
Linear Models, which are extensions of the basic linear regression. The models
are generally a transformation of the linear regression to fit data in different
ways.  

In the case of logistic regression, we use a *sigmoid* function on the linear
model.  

## What is the sigmoid function?  

The sigmoid function is the following:  
![equation1][sigmoid]  
If you aren't a math-person, this probably does not mean much to you, so here's
a visual to better understand it:  
![graph1][sigmoidplot]  
Notice that the output (range) of the sigmoid function is from 0 to 1 exclusive
(without 0 or 1). We can then use this function to represent the probability of
a data observation being a 0 or a 1, depending on how 0 and 1 are defined.  

## How do we apply the sigmoid function to linear regression?  

That's simple; just apply the sigmoid function to a linear model.
We learned in previous weeks that the matrix multiplication of `X` and `theta`
is the vector representing the prediction of a linear regression model. Applying
the sigmoid function to `X*theta`, we get a new hypothesis function:  
![equation2][hypothesis]  
Based on our training data `X` and parameters `theta`, our hypothesis function
generates the probability that each observation will correspond to `1`.  

Now that we have a general idea of how the logistic regression works, we can
figure out the cost function and which optimization algorithm to use for it.  

## Can we use the same cost function as in linear regression?  

For linear regression, we used:  
![equation3][linearJ]  
Let's try it!
